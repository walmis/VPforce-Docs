# Introduction

## Third-Party Vendors & Open Ecosystem

VPforce fosters an accessible ecosystem for force feedback enthusiasts and builders. We actively support the DIY community by offering motor kits and components, enabling builders to construct their own high-performance force feedback devices. These devices are compatible with a wide range of grips and other hardware from various manufacturers, promoting a diverse and innovative simulation hardware landscape.

This philosophy encourages innovation and empowers the flight simulation community. We believe that users should have the freedom to choose the best components for their setup, and builders should have a powerful, reliable platform to create their own unique devices.

By providing the core force-feedback technology, we enable third-party vendors and DIY builders to:

*   **Create and Sell Custom Devices:** Use the VPforce Rhino base as the foundation for complete, ready-to-fly FFB joysticks and controls.

*   **Build Specialized Hardware:** Integrate VPforce technology into other unique simulation hardware.

This section highlights vendors and projects from the community that have embraced this open-source spirit and are offering their devices.
