## Community Projects

Welcome to the Community Projects section, a showcase of the incredible ingenuity and passion within the VPforce community. Here, you will find a curated collection of do-it-yourself (DIY) projects created by talented users who have adapted and expanded the VPforce ecosystem.

These projects range from converting standard rudder pedals into full force-feedback systems to designing custom hardware from the ground up. Each guide provides detailed instructions, parts lists, and 3D-printable files to help you build your own advanced simulation hardware.
