Motorized Trim Wheel for VPForce Rhino ecosystem!

Maintained at https://github.com/smitty97/FFB-Trim-Wheel

You can move the wheel by hand, or watch it go with your trim buttons.  It will move on its own in autopilot.

Support is already included for MSFS in the TelemFFB app.  Just add the Trim device in System Settings.

Assembly Notes

Refer to the STEP assy for parts to print. 

Print trimwheel with spiral on build plate, no supports. 

Print the trim indicator in white, and add a little dab of white paint to the indicator cover centering triangle

The main alum plate can be ordered from SendCutSend.com.  Order without the countersinks, its easy to add them with a drill later

Power up the 57BLF01 motor with calibration at 0-4096 and apply spring force to center.  Mark the shaft-housing alignment with a sharpie.

When assembiling the unit with the belt, keep the motor centered and the indicator tab centered in the spiral.  The spiral wheel also has a triangle that should point toward the motor for its center position.  See pic below:

Check full trim wheel rotation during recalibration, if you go under 0 or over 4096, move the belt to another tooth

You will have to design a bracket to mount to the side of your particular rig frame or throttle quadrant
