### Commit Message Guidelines

* Use **imperative mood**, e.g. `Fix motor calibration issue`, not `Fixed` or `Fixes`.
* Keep the **first line under 72 characters**.
* Capitalize the first word, **no period** at the end of the title.
* Optionally include a short body after one blank line if clarification is needed.
* Describe **what** was changed and **why**, not **how**.
* Avoid filler like “update”, “refactor”, or “misc changes” — be specific.
* Prefix commits if relevant:

  * `fix:` – for bug fixes
  * `feat:` – for new features
  * `docs:` – for documentation changes
  * `build:` – for build system changes
  * `ci:` – for CI/CD changes
  * `refactor:` – for non-functional code restructuring

**Examples:**

```
fix: prevent crash when config file missing
feat: add telemetry logging to FFB service
docs: clarify firmware update procedure
```
